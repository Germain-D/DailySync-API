### **TO DO**

- [ ] Add **Smart Caching System**  
  - Implement an in-memory cache using `go-cache` to store API responses and reduce redundant external API calls.  
  - Set cache expiration times tailored to each data type (e.g., weather, tides, Bitcoin price).  
  - Ensure cache invalidation when data becomes stale or outdated.  

- [ ] Add **Health Check Endpoint**  
  - Create a `/health` endpoint to monitor the status of the API and its dependencies.
